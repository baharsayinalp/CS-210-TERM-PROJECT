# My-Tiktok-Data-Analysis
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.

# Description
I am Bahar SayÄ±nalp (32296) and my project is about analyzing your TikTok usage data to uncover patterns and correlations;


  -How time of the day effects my tiktok usage time.
  
  -What kind of content I watch on tiktok.
  
  -How is my productivity levels correlated with time spent on tiktok

# Motivation
I use tiktok often throughout the day. Therefore, I want to see how much it has an impact on my life.

# Data Resources
Primary Dataset: I will directly download the Tiktok Data from the app. It will include the videos I've watched and how long i've spent time on tiktok.

Details:

  Timestamped Activity Logs: Records of usage duration and interactions.
  
  Engagement Metrics: Likes, comments, shares (if included).
  
  Content Categories: Information about video types or hashtags (if available).
  
Secondary Dataset (Productivity): My productivity is based on how much time I spent on studying. I only study on GoodNotes app. I will compare the time I spend on GoodNotes with I spend on Tiktok in a day. 

# Plan
I am going to export the data from Tiktok app and I will convert JSON or CSV TikTok data into a usable format. Then, when neccessary, I will merge the data with secondary datasets. 

I am gonna perform statistical analysis to find correlation between time of the day an time spent on tiktok; productivity levels and time spent on tiktok etc.

EDA(Explanatory Data Analysis): I am going to use visualization to analyze the trends in daily and weekly TikTok usage. I am also going to use Metrics to calculate the total and average time spent on tiktok.

# Expectation
I will try to find similar patterns in usage and engagement on Tiktok
