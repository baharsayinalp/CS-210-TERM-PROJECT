# My-Tiktok-Data-Analysis
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.

# Description
I am Bahar SayÄ±nalp (32296) and my project is about analyzing my TikTok usage data to uncover patterns and correlations;


  -How time of the day affects my tiktok usage time.
  
  -What kind of content I watch on tiktok.
  
  -How are my productivity levels correlated with time spent on tiktok.

This project aims to identify trends and insights into how TikTok usage influences my daily habits and overall productivity.

# Motivation
I use Tiktok often throughout the day. Therefore, I want to see how much it has an impact on my life.

# Data Resources
The primary dataset for this project is my TikTok usage data, which I will directly download it from the app. This data set includes timestamped activity logs, providing details about time spent on tiktok and which contents I engage with. If available, it will also include the number of likes, comments, shares and hashtag information about the videos I watch. 

My secondary dataset will be the measurement of the time I spend on GoodNotes app, which I use for studying. This database will provide information about my productivity levels daily. Comparing these two datasets will help me to see if my productivty is correlated with my Tiktok usage.
  
# Plan
1.**Data Collection**:  
   - Export TikTok usage data in JSON or CSV format.  
   - Log productivity data from the GoodNotes app.  

2. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Clean and preprocess the TikTok data to extract useful features, including timestamps, engagement metrics, and content types.  
   - Merge the TikTok dataset with productivity logs to enable correlation analysis.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Use visualizations (e.g., histograms, heatmaps) to analyze daily and weekly TikTok usage trends.  
   - Calculate correlation metrics to assess relationships between productivity levels and TikTok usage.  

# Expectation
I aim to find patterns in my Tiktok usage, including timestamps I use Tiktok the most and content preferences. Moreover, I hope to decide whether Tiktok lowers my productivity levels. My goal to gain a clear insight and try to optimize my life according to the outcomes I am going to find due to these datasets.
