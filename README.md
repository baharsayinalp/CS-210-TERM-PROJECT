Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.
#Description
I am Bahar SayÄ±nalp (32296) and my project is about exploring the correlation between my spotify music listening habits and contents I engage with on tiktok. The aim of the project is to find out the influence of the music used in Tiktok videos I watch on the music I listen on spotify.
#Motivation
I use tiktok often throughout the day. Therefore I wanna see how much it shapes my music preferences.
